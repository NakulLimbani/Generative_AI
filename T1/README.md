# Tutorial 1: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on MNIST

---

## Objective
This tutorial explores the implementation and training of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic handwritten digits inspired by the MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates the fundamentals of GANs, including their adversarial training process and practical applications.

---

## Key Features
- Implementation of Generator and Discriminator networks.
- Training with adversarial loss over 100 epochs.
- Visualizations of generated images and loss trends.

---

## Usage
- Execute the included notebooks to train the models from scratch or to evaluate pretrained models.
- Visualize training progress through the provided loss curves and generated image outputs.
