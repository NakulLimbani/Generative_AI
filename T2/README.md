# Tutorial 2: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on CIFAR-10

---

## Objective
This tutorial demonstrates the implementation and training of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic CIFAR-10 images. It explores the adversarial learning process and evaluates the quality of generated images.

---

## Key Features
- Generator and Discriminator network implementations.
- Adversarial training over 100 epochs.
- Visualizations of generated images and loss trends.
- Evaluation using FID and Inception Score.

---

## Usage
- Run the provided notebook to train the GAN or evaluate pretrained models.
- Visualize training progress and inspect generated images at different epochs.
